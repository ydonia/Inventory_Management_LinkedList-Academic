There is an admin account When a user makes an account, that account can either be a manager or not. 
If the account is not a manager, accessibility is limited. 
Passwords are encrypted using hashing. 
The data here is stored using a Linked List.
There is a parent class for the menu called Command, and multiple child classes for all the different types of commands in order for the menu to be dynamic based on the commands supplied in the parsed file. Each type of command was assigned to a menu option.
